## Bug 1: Delete button not working
**Description:** When attempting to delete a task using the delete button, it fails to remove the task from the list. This results in the inability to properly manage or remove tasks from the todo list.
**Impact:** Users are unable to efficiently manage their todo list, leading to clutter and difficulty in organizing tasks.

## Bug 2: Taking empty input field
**Description:** The system allows the user to submit an empty input field when adding a new task. This results in the addition of empty or meaningless tasks to the todo list.
**Impact:** Clutters the todo list with empty tasks, making it difficult for users to differentiate between meaningful tasks and empty placeholders.

## Bug 3: Not taking string as input
**Description:** The system does not accept string inputs when adding new tasks. It may only accept numeric inputs or specific formats, failing to cater to a broader range of task descriptions.
**Impact:** Limits the usability of the todo list as users are unable to input task descriptions in a natural and intuitive manner, potentially leading to frustration and difficulty in task management.

## Bug 4: After clicking the checkbox, todo task color must be Green
**Description:** Upon clicking the checkbox associated with a task, the color of the task does not change to green as expected. This visual feedback is crucial for users to quickly identify completed tasks.
**Impact:** Lack of visual feedback can confuse users about the status of their tasks, making it difficult to differentiate between completed and pending tasks.

## Bug 5: Remove the Maximum Limit
**Description:** There is a maximum limit imposed on the number of tasks that can be added to the todo list. This limit restricts users from adding more tasks beyond a certain threshold.
**Impact:** Users may be unable to fully utilize the todo list for their task management needs, especially if they have a large number of tasks to manage. This limitation hinders productivity and usability of the application.
